Hello, I am a high school student. I created this work with the aim of helping those who struggle to learn a foreign language. English is a widely spoken language globally, and almost everyone knows at least a little bit of English. For those trying to learn a language other than their native one (such as Spanish, French, or German), it has been shown that they can learn their target language more easily if they can get help from both their native language and English simultaneously. For this reason, I decided to write this dictionary, which provides results in two languages at once. I hope it will be helpful to everyone who is trying to learn a foreign language. If you would like to help me get my driver's license, I would greatly appreciate it if you could click the donation button and support me. I wish you all the best in advance
